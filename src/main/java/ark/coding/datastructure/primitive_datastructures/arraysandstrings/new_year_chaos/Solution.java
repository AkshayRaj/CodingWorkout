     * For the full problem description, check
     * https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/new-year-chaos/problem?isFullScreen=true
     *
     * Solving Approach:-
     * My first approach to this problem, was to go from start to end (0 to length-1),
     * and keep track of persons (in memory) who were both "briber" as well as "bribee";
     * It's straightforward to know how many bribes were given by people who were ahead in the queue,
     * but it was not straightforward to understand if a person has not given <i>any</i> bribe,
     * if he is in the original position; either because -
     * 1. he did not accept any bribes
     * 2. He accepted a bribe, and gave one, to come back to his original position.
     * That approach led me down to a rabbithole, and ultimately I was not able to write a solution which passed all 12 test cases.
     *
     * SECOND APPROACH:-
     * I came across this solution on the web, namely - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWYF6bOhPW8
     * This approach is position-centric, as opposed to the person-centric approach in the previous attempt.
     * - We start from the end of the queue, and check if the position in the queue has the expected person,
     * or if the expected person has bribed towards the head by 1 or 2 places.
     * - If the expected peron is not found in the current position, we restore the original position of the person,
     * and slide our "window" to the left.
     * - This way we preserve the ordering of the "bribees" and count the number of bribes that have taken place,
     *   until the current position under consideration.
     *
     * Glossary:
     * Briber: Person who has given a bribe to move up in the queue.
     * Bribee: Person who has accepted a bribe, moved down in the queue.
     *
     * @param queue current state of the queue.
     * @return minimum number of bribes to get the queue to its given state.

         * Some after thoughts to this approach:
         * One of the benefits of going from end of the array towards the start is, we can "look-ahead" two places,
         * and make a unambiguous decision regarding the person who is expected to be at a given position.
         * Since, a person can <i>only</i> move two places up (remember: he can give only two bribes), the "look-ahead"
         * is easier to perform.
         *
         * One the other hand, there is no limit to the number of bribes a person can accept.
         * If we iterate from 0 -> n, then the "look-ahead" is not definitive;
         * a person could be at the last place in the list, as he can take as many bribes.
         *
         * Iteration from end -> start :
         * As we iterate from the end of the array towards the start, we "swap" the persons, which have bribed their way up.
         * By swapping, we reduce the "window" size of the array, thus reducing our problem size.
         * One important thing we observe is the order of the "bribees", while performing the swap -
         * - If the expected person has bribed two places up, we keep the order between the i-1 & i-1 persons in the current
         *   state of the queue. This gives us fidelity that other bribes performed are not "undone" accidentally.
         *
         * ==========
         * Actively changing the state of the {@code queue} by swapping, reduces the need to hold additional data/calculations in the memory.
         * By "undoing" the bribes, we actively try to restore the original state of the queue, one swap at a time.
         * So, our solution reduces to keep track of "swaps" which undo the bribes.
