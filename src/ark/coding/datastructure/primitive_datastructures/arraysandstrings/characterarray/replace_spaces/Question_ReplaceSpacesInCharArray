Given a character Array, replace all spaces with '%20'
Assume array length is large enough to accomodate for the extra characters.
Extra spaces are given at the end of the array to account for the %20
Assume true length is given
Example:
Input : ("Mr John Smith    ", 13)
Output: ("Mr%20John%20Smith")
