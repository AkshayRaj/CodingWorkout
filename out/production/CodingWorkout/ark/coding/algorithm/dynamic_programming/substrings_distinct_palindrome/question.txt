Distinct palindromic sub-strings of the given string using Dynamic Programming
Given a string `str` of lowercase alphabets, the task is to find all distinct palindromic sub-strings of the given string.

Examples:

Input: str = “abaaa”
Output: 5
Palindromic sub-strings are “a”, “aa”, “aaa”, “aba” and “b”

Input: str = “abcd”
